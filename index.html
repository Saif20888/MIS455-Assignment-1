    <h1>Welcome to the Burj Al Arab</h1>
    <br>

    <p>The Burj Al Arab (Arabic: برج العرب, lit.'Arab Tower') is a luxury hotel in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Developed and managed by Jumeirah, it is one of the tallest hotels in the world, although 39% of its total height is made up of non-occupiable space. Burj Al Arab stands on an artificial island that is 280 m (920 ft) from Jumeirah Beach and is connected to the mainland by a private curving bridge. The shape of the structure is designed to resemble the sail of a dhow. It has a helipad near the roof, at a height of 210 m (689 ft) above ground.

        As of 2022 (post-COVID), the 25th floor, which once housed two 100,000 AED/night royal suites, has been converted to a museum. One royal suite has been preserved to retain its original furnishings. The other royal suite has been gutted and replaced by exhibitions about the building's construction, engineering and architectural design.</p>
        <br>

    <p>The Burj Al Arab was designed by the multidisciplinary consultancy Atkins, led by architect Tom Wright of WKA. He came up with the iconic design and signature translucent fiberglass facade that serves as a shield from the desert sun during the day and as a screen for illumination at night. The design and construction were managed by Canadian engineer Rick Gregory, also of WS Atkins. The Burj Al Arab's interior is by British-Chinese designer Khuan Chew. Construction of the island began in 1994 and involved up to 2,000 construction workers during peak construction. Two "wings" spread in a V to form a vast "mast", while the space between them is enclosed in a massive atrium. The setting of a high rise building on saturated soil and the novelty of the project required groundbreaking dynamic analysis and design to take into consideration soil-structure interaction, effect of water, high winds, and helipad among other loads, to help finalize the design and take the project into construction.

        The hotel was built by South African construction contractor Murray & Roberts, now renamed Concor and Al Habtoor Engineering. The interior designs were led and created by Khuan Chew and John Coralan of KCA international and delivered by UAE based Depa Group.
        
        The building opened on 1 December 1999.
        
        The hotel's helipad was designed by Irish architect Rebecca Gernon. The helipad is at the building's 28th floor, and the helipad been used as a car race track, a boxing ring, has hosted a tennis match, and the jumping off point for the highest kite surfing jump in history.
